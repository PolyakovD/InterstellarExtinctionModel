# Interstellar Extinction Model

We present a new version of our analytical model of the spatial interstellar extinction variations within the nearest kiloparsec from the Sun. This model treats the three-dimensional (3D) dust distribution as a superposition of three overlapping layers: the layer along the Galactic midplane, the layer in the Gould Belt, and the layer passing through the Cepheus and Chamaeleon dust cloud complexes. In each layer the dust density decreases exponentially with increasing distance from the midplane of the layer. In addition, there are sinusoidal longitudinal extinction variations along the midplane of each layer. We have found the most probable values of 29 parameters of our model using four data sets: the 3D stellar reddening maps by Gontcharov and Mosenkov (2017), Lallement et al. (2019), and Green et al. (2019) and the extinctions inferred by Anders et al. (2022) for 993 291 giants from the Gaia Early Data Release 3. All of the data give similar estimates of the model parameters.
